# Angular Application

This is an example application that is built in Angular.
At the point of writing, it represents a few hours worth of effort to familiarize myself with Angular.

If you are interested in running it yourself, ensure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) and the latest version of [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

After downloading the prequisities, navigate to the project directory and run ng serve to start up a local server on `http://localhost:4200/`.

As this was a rather rushed project, there are no tests and the terminal on the home page has yet to be fully completed.
